# MutatedShadow Usage

You can either use the **zip file** in the submission or clone from **github** to execute my framework.

## Start From Zip File

1. Uncompress the zip file.
2. **geo** is our demo target project, developed by some guy from github.
3. **geo/MutatedShadow/** encloses the framework byte-code and source code.
4. $ cd geo
5. $ cd MutatedShadow
6. $ ./shadow.sh
7. Wait for the execution.
8. Check out reports from geo/MutatedShadow/report

## Start From github

1. $ git clone https://github.com/davidmoten/geo.git
2. $ cd geo
3. $ git clone https://github.com/qizt/MutatedShadow.git
4. $ cd MutatedShadow
5. $ ./shadow.sh
6. Wait for the execution.
7. Check out reports from geo/MutatedShadow/report

Either of the two ways should have no problem. I gave a successful demo with github on the presentation.
